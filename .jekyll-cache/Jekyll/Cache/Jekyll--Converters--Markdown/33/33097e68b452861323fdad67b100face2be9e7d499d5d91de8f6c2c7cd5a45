I"8<h1 id="early-years">Early Years</h1>

<p>I have a great deal of experience of working with very young children; I have a strong background in early years work, and I have developed techniques of building the beginnings of narrative threads with little ones.</p>

<p>I can offer varied programmes of stories, seasoned with songs, rhymes and movement to help even the smallest children to maintain their interest and focus. I can offer programmes that are suited to the seasons or any other theme.
As always, my repertoire is based on traditional and folk tales, and I also have skill in helping children to create stories on the spot, perhaps with a few props to prompt their imagination.</p>

<p>I have considerable experience of family storytelling with mixed age groups in libraries and at festivals.</p>

<p>I have been a teacher and senior manager in a childrenâ€™s centre; I have Early Years Professional Status; I am trained as an Early Language Lead Practitioner with the Every Child a Talker initiative and I have had training and experience with Letters and Sounds.</p>
