<blockquote>
  <p>Cath has a warm and witty style of storytelling and she has a wonderful sense of humour.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My repertoire is largely based on traditional and folk tales. I revel in sourcing stories, making them my own and passing them on so that my audiences can love them as much as I do</p>

<p>I learnt a love of folklore and stories as a small child; as an adult I told stories to my own children, and, as a teacher, worked with children through story. I now tell stories to adult audiences, family audiences, very young children, school-age children and children and young people with special needs.</p>

<p>I am co-host of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lichfieldstorytellers/">Lichfield Storytellers</a> and the Society for Storytelling Midlands representative. My book <a href="https://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/publication/west-midlands-folk-tales/9780750985390/">West Midlands Folk Tales</a> is available from The History Press; Warwickshire Folk Tales is in preparation. Why not like my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cathedwardsstorytellerandauthor/?epa=SEARCH_BOX">facebook page</a> for news of my latest projects.</p>
