        <h1>Writing for Children</h1>
        <p>‘Literacy skills are crucial to pupils’ learning in other subjects across the curriculum’<br/>
        <strong>Ofsted, Moving English Forward, 2012</strong></p>

          <p>As an experienced teacher and storyteller, I can bring a fresh, lively and invigorating style to creative writing workshops for children, offering exciting starting points to stimulate children to create their own original work. </p>

          <p>My workshops include a variety of absorbing exercises which will help the children to develop some of the necessary skills of creative writing: writing plausible characters, dialogue, plot and description. Depending on the age of the participants, I may include reflection on point of view and how to draw in the reader. </p>

          <p>The children will each have completed several pieces of short writing by the end of the workshop and will have had the encouragement and stimulus to continue writing.</p>

          <p>I am a keen writer and I have taught creative writing to adults. My approach was to identify needs and interests within the group and to devise exercises accordingly, as well as maintaining a friendly supportive atmosphere where students felt safe to share their work. My creative writing class was rated ‘Excellent’ by Ofsted.</p>

          <p>I am very experienced as a special educator and I am more than happy to bring creative writing and literacy workshops to special schools and settings. I specialise in children with SLD, PMLD and ASD.</p>

          <p>I am a member of the National Association of Writers in Education.</p>
