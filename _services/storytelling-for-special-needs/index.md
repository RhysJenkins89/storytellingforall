# Special Needs

I delight in adapting stories to include all children in a full and absorbing experience of narrative. I use a range of multi-sensory props as well as music and other sounds to offer the children a variety of routes to access the story in their own way. I always leave room for the children to make their own contributions to the story in whatever way they can.

Stories can take place in a classroom, a larger room or hall, or in a sensory room. I have a number of story boxes that I have designed and assembled especially for sensory room work, but I am able to adapt all stories to suit the group and the space available. I am also experienced in creating stories with a group; please do contact me to discuss your requirements.

I have enjoyed a teaching career of over thirty years, working mainly with early years children and youngsters of all ages with severe learning difficulties (SLD), profound and multiple learning difficulties (PMLD) and autistic spectrum condition (ASC). I am an experienced Makaton signer and I am familiar with communication technology. I have trained staff countrywide in disability issues, and I also run training in storytelling for staff who work with people with SLD, PMLD and ASD, including at Birmingham University on the distance learning Special Needs course.

With co-authors Martin Goodwin and Jennie Miller, I have published the book ‘Communicate with Me: A Resource to Enable Effective Communication and Involvement with People Who Have a Learning Disability’ [Communicate with Me](https://www.facebook.com/communicatewithme/)
