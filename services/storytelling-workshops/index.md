#Storytelling Workshops

Get started as a storyteller, increase your confidence and have fun. Oral storytelling without books is a vital and living art form, rooted in tradition but fresh and alive today. Children and adults alike love the immediacy, the sharing and the communication that they experience when telling a story face to face.

With my extensive knowledge of both child learning and storytelling, added to my skills as a Master Practitioner of Neuro-Linguistic Programming, I lead workshops for teachers and other staff that are fun and informative. You will increase your knowledge of story sources, and traditional and real-life stories including family stories, and you will learn a variety of storytelling techniques in a safe and supportive atmosphere.

I am a very experienced trainer, with a background in training school, nursery and childrenâ€™s centre staff and others. I also specialise in training staff who work with people with a learning disability: see the Special Needs section.
