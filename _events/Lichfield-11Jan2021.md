## Lichfield Storytellers: Medieval Midwinter Merriment with Dave Tonge  

or, "Sir Cleges and the Christmas Cherries and other tales oft told in medieval times". When Mother Winter cloaked the land with ice it was time to gather, be it by your own hearth or in the alehouse, enjoying warmth and good company as the storyteller spins many a merry tale. Hearken unto his words!

Dave Tonge, the Yarnsmith of Norwich, makes a very welcome return to Lichfield Storytellers.
